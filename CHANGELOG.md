## 1.0.2 ##

Add `camera` & `distance` for `DrawWireRectTransform` to support camera mode of a canvas.

## 1.0.1 ##

1.  Add `Window/Saints/Draw` menu to toggle gizmos drawing. Useful when you want to do some profiler but `gizmos` drawing is too heavy.
2.  Gizmos drawing is disable in build (it will not draw anything in build anyway)
3.  Add `DrawWireRectTransform` for `RectTransform` in UI
